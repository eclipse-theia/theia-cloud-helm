| app.logo | string | `"logos/theiablueprint.svg"` | The logo of the application that should be displayed on the landing pages |
| app.logoData | string | `nil` | set app.logoData=$(cat path/to/file.svg | base64 -w 0 -) Another way is to directly add the base64 string to the values file. |
| app.logoFileExtension | string | `"svg"` | The file extension of the logo. Must be set to match the logo respectively the logoData. This is required because browsers cannot show a binary image (e.g. png) with a svg ending and vice-versa. |

Please note that this means that this usually means that all "ingressHostnamePrefixes" patterns from all app definitions need to be added. These are required to configure TLS (if enabled via ingress.tls == true) |

| ingress.instanceName | string | `"theia-cloud-demo-ws-ingress"` | The name of the ingress which will be updated to publish new theia application. If this is not existing it will be created. You may chose to set the ingress up yourself and point Theia Cloud to the ingress via the name |
| ingress.proxyBodySize | string | `"1m"` | Sets the maximum allowed size of the client request body inside the application (e.g. file uploads in Theia). Defaults to 1m. Setting size to 0 disables checking of client request body size. |
